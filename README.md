# thermo_qe_api_example

This is an example program using the [QE acquisition API](https://github.com/thermofisherlsms/iapi), intended as a 
helpful reference for developers.  The system is not necessarily intended to work "out of the box" but should 
demonstrate tricky points such as instrument configuration and interface steps, spectral processing in C#, and 
how to manipulate the Thermo datatypes effectively.

It is not necessarily intended to work "out of the box," and would likely require significant updates to account for
your particular intstrument, updates to the API, and other maitenance before being usable.
